This is a pre-recorded conference call that will provide you with important information on the requirements and expectations of our review process. We expect that this information will also enable you to make an informed decision about a commitment to participate, and allow you to adequately prepare your expectations for engagement in the review.

After you listen to the Confirmation Call there are required elements that you will need to document and respond in order to secure your confirmation.
 
Please note that informing us of your availability does not guarantee you a spot on a panel. Review Participants are selected by CNCS for each grant competition based on their relevant qualifications (which include experience in high priority focus areas or experience in multiple focus areas), their responsiveness, as well as the number of grant applications received; thus some respondents might be placed in the Alternate Reviewer category.
 
Thank you again for your willingness to participate and your prompt response, and we encourage continued responsiveness should questions arise, or if your availability changes!
 
Thank you,
