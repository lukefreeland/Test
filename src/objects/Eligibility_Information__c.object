        <fullName>Maximum_Cost_per_MSY__c</fullName>
        <defaultValue>&quot;Maximum Costs per MSY are set forth below. The CNCS cost per MSY is determined by dividing the CNCS share of budgeted grant costs by the number of MSYs requested. It does not include child care or the value of the education award a member may earn. The maximum amount an applicant may request from CNCS per MSY is determined on an annual basis. New and recompeting State Commission sub-grantees/applicants will be held to the maximum cost per MSY for their grant type. The maximum cost per MSY are defined by the grant program and are as follows: Individual Competitive State/Territory Program (cost reimbursement) $13,730; Multi-state (cost reimbursement) $13,730; Professional Corps Grant (Cost Reimbursement) Up to $1,000*; Professional Corps Fixed Amount Grant Up to $1,000*; Education Award Program Fixed Amount Grant $800; Fulltime Fixed Amount Grant $13,430;  State/Territory Commission Formula Prime $18,000; Individual State/Territory Formula Program $20,000; State/Territory Commission Average (of all its subgrants) $13,730. *CNCS’ assumption is that Professional Corps will be covering the operating expenses associated with the AmeriCorps program through non CNCS funds and thus will not be requesting operating funds as part of their applications. CNCS will consider operating funds of up to $1,000 per MSY if an applicant is able to demonstrate in its narrative and supporting budget materials significant organizational financial need and substantial challenges to raising non CNCS resources. Programs operating in rural communities (as defined in the Glossary) and programs that recruit opportunity youth as AmeriCorps members may request up to $13,930 cost per MSY for the AmeriCorps members that will be serving in rural areas or who are opportunity youth. The applicant must include a compelling case as to why the applicant’s cost per MSY must be higher.&quot;</defaultValue>

        <defaultValue>&quot;The proposed budget must include a living allowance for full-time members that is between $12,530 (minimum) and $25,060 (maximum) per member except as noted below. A living allowance is not considered a salary or a wage. Cost reimbursement programs are not required to provide a living allowance for members serving in less than full-time terms of service. If a program chooses to provide a living allowance to a less than full-time member, it must comply with the maximum limits below. For Cost Reimbursement grants, the amount must be included in the proposed budget as either CNCS or grantee share. (EXCEPTION: as noted in Section B.1. and B.3.) While Fixed Amount grant applicants are not required to submit detailed budgets, they are still required to provide a living allowance that complies with the minimum and maximum requirements to members (EXCEPTION: as noted in section B.2. and B.3.) Most Fixed Amount grant applicants are not required to indicate that amount in the application and should request those positions as “without living allowance” in the budget. The minimum and maximum living allowance amounts are based on the member service term. A full time service term (1,700 hours) must have a minimum living allowance of $12,530 and a maximum living allowance of $25,060. The remaining service terms only have a maximum living allowance requirement. The one-year halftime (900 hours) service term maximum is $13,265. The reduced half-time (675 hours) service term maximum is $9,950. The quarter time (450 hours) service term maximum is $6,635. The minimum time (300 hours) service term maximum is $4,420.&quot;</defaultValue>
